    <summary>Real-time synchronization of a Pydio workspace against a local folder on your computer</summary>
    <description>
PydioSync is the desktop client for Pydio v6. It is offers real-time synchronization of a Pydio workspace against a local folder on your computer. Currently, we provide installers for Windows and MacOS, and binaries for Linux as well.

#### Features

* Multi platform support: Mac, Windows, Linux
* Native installers for Mac and Windows
* Great User Experience: configuration wizards
* Real-time synchronisation, manual, or time-based
* Admin allow users to sync a workspace or not
* Ability to sync only a subfolder
* Sync direction: bi-directionnal (standard), upload only (backup), download only (mirror)
* Run sync agent “headless” (without UI) on a remote server – configure via the browser
* Configure many sync tasks against different Pydio servers or workspaces
* Pause/Resume all sync – Temporary disable a task

#### Pydio Server requirements:
* v6 or later
* SQL Database available
* API properly configured
* If using SSL, make sure to use a properly validated certificate

#### Workpsaces requirements:
* Meta.syncable plugin active (via Workspace Features)
* FileHasher plugin active
* Metastore plugin active (to cache file hashes)
* If pydio <= 6.0.3, Index.lucene must be active as well

#### Indexation notice:
* On the server-side, the changes are continuously indexed so that the sync client only receives the modification of the tree when required. For this reason, if you are planning to modify the data of a workspace from outside pydio, you have to set up a specific strategy to make sure to keep pydio in sync.
